# CasioBasic
Another mish-mash of code written in Casio Basic. Written for the fx-9860GII, might work on other calculators, not really sure.

Casio Basic is a low-level interpreted language (making it considerably inefficient and slow) used on CASIO devices. The functionality and extent changes from device to device, but it uses the same general functionality and commands. I haven't really found an indepth tutorial, so I might make one. Most of my programs run at sub 10 FPS, maybe 5 FPS if you're lucky, sadly that is due to the lower power of the calculator. Though, I do believe Casio Basic is more powerful than Batchfile, being able to do floating-point math and many powerful mathematical functions (and, maybe it runs slightly faster?).

## File Types
- **.g1m** - Full "compiled" (formatted) file to be added to your calculator through the cable and [CASIO FA-124](https://edu.casio.com/forteachers/er/software/) (scroll to "Program Link Software"). Will create several files upon installation onto the calculator.
- **.bide** - Full plain-text file meant for use when opening the file using [BIDE](https://www.planet-casio.com/Fr/logiciels/voir_un_logiciel_casio.php?showid=118) (by Zezombye, requires Java).
- **.casiobasic** - An imaginary file type for the individual programs that will be extracted once installed onto your calculator; but in plain-text.

## Programs
- **galaxy**, a basic "destroy the asteroids and upgrade your ship" kind of game. It runs very slowly, both because of the high amount of objects, and the inefficiency of the code. The game is unfinished and lacking of ship upgrades, but it's the first game that really showed me you can do some impressive stuff with Casio Basic.
